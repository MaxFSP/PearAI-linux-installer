Place your PearAI source files here (.tar.gz format)
------------------------------------------------

This directory should contain the PearAI application source files in .tar.gz format.
Before running the installation script, please ensure:

1. You have obtained the official PearAI application files
2. The files are compressed in .tar.gz format
3. The archive is named "PearAI.tar.gz" (case-sensitive)

Note: The source_files_in_tar.txt file is just a placeholder and should be replaced
with the actual PearAI.tar.gz file containing the application binaries and dependencies.
